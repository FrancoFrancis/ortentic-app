Sure, here is a more comprehensive version of the requested scope of study:

Introduction:
Discipleship is a fundamental aspect of Christianity, and it is central to the Great Commission, where Jesus commanded his 
disciples to "go and make disciples of all nations" (Matthew 28:19). Effective discipleship involves teaching and mentoring 
others in the ways of Christ and helping them grow in their faith. However, there are several challenges that hinder effective 
discipleship, and understanding these challenges is crucial for addressing them.

Issues in discipleship:
Discipleship involves much more than just imparting knowledge or information to individuals. It requires modeling the Christian 
life and establishing a close relationship between the mentor and the disciple. Discipleship is also a lifelong process that requires
ongoing commitment and effort from both the mentor and the disciple. Additionally, discipleship involves spiritual formation, where 
individuals are transformed into the image of Christ and equipped to fulfill their unique calling.

Challenges of discipleship:
Despite its importance, effective discipleship is often hindered by several challenges. Some of the significant challenges of 
discipleship include:

a) Lack of commitment: Many people are not committed to discipleship, either as mentors or as disciples. This lack of commitment
 hinders the development of a discipleship culture in the church.

b) Lack of discipleship culture: Many churches do not have a strong discipleship culture, where discipleship is not 
considered a priority. This lack of culture makes it difficult to create an environment that fosters discipleship.

c) Lack of resources: Effective discipleship requires resources, such as time, money, and trained mentors. Many 
churches lack these resources, making it difficult to implement effective discipleship programs.

d) Lack of understanding: Some individuals do not understand the importance of discipleship or are unaware of how 
to get involved in discipleship programs. This lack of understanding can prevent them from participating in discipleship
 or seeking out mentors.

e) Inadequate models: In some cases, individuals may not have access to appropriate models or mentors, making it 
challenging to learn and grow in their faith.

f) Cultural barriers: In some cultures, discipleship may not be a familiar concept or may be viewed as something 
only for new believers. This cultural barrier can hinder the development of a strong discipleship culture in the church.

Challenges of discipleship according to scholars:
Several scholars have discussed the challenges of effective discipleship. Some of the notable scholars include:
a) Dallas Willard: Willard identifies the lack of intentionality and vision as significant challenges to effective 
discipleship. He argues that discipleship must be intentional, with a clear vision of what it means to be a disciple of Christ.

b) Greg Ogden: Ogden identifies the lack of discipleship culture as a significant challenge to effective discipleship.
 He argues that churches must create a culture that prioritizes discipleship, where mentoring relationships are a natural
  part of church life.

c) Bill Hull: Hull identifies the lack of commitment as a significant challenge to effective discipleship. He argues
 that churches must encourage commitment and create opportunities for people to commit to discipleship.

d) Michael Wilkins: Wilkins identifies the lack of biblical literacy as a significant challenge to effective discipleship.
 He argues that discipleship must involve a deep understanding of Scripture, which is essential for spiritual growth and formation.

Effects of these challenges:
The effects of this challenge are significant. When individuals lack commitment to discipleship, they may miss out on opportunities 
for spiritual growth and development. They may also struggle to fully engage in the life of the church and to serve God and others
 effectively. Furthermore, a lack of commitment to discipleship can result in a lack of overall commitment to the church, which
  can weaken the church's impact on the community.



  The effects of this challenge are also significant. Without sufficient resources, churches may struggle to provide 
  effective discipleship programs, hindering the growth and development of individuals and the church as a whole. This 
  can result in a lack of spiritual maturity among church members and a weakened ability to fulfill the church's mission 
  of making disciples and spreading the gospel.


  The effects of cultural barriers can also be significant. Cultural barriers can prevent individuals from fully 
  engaging in the discipleship process, hindering their growth and development. They can also create divisions within 
  the church and limit the effectiveness of the church's discipleship programs. Churches must work to understand the
   cultural context in which they operate and adapt their discipleship programs accordingly.



   The effects of this challenge are significant as well. Without a deep understanding of the gospel and biblical principles,
    individuals may struggle to grow in their faith and to fully engage in the life of the church. Churches must prioritize
     teaching and education to help individuals develop a deeper understanding of these concepts.


     The effects of a lack of accountability can also be significant. Without accountability, individuals may struggle
      to maintain their commitment to discipleship, hindering their growth and development. Churches must prioritize 
      developing mentorship relationships and creating a culture of accountability to help individuals stay on track in 
      their spiritual growth.


      The effects of limited time can be significant as well. Limited time can make it challenging for individuals to fully
       engage in discipleship, hindering their growth and development. Churches must work to create discipleship programs that
        are flexible and adaptable to individuals' busy schedules.

        Overall, the challenges of effective discipleship are numerous and significant. However, by understanding these
         challenges and working to address them, churches can create a culture of discipleship that fosters spiritual growth,
          maturity, and service. The effects of effective discipleship can 


          be transformative, both for individuals and for the church as a whole. Effective discipleship can lead to a deeper understanding of the gospel, a greater commitment to spiritual growth, and a stronger sense of community within the church. It can also equip individuals to serve God and others more effectively and to fulfill the church's mission of making disciples and spreading the gospel.

In the case of ECWA Gobe DCC, there may be specific challenges related to the context in which the church operates. For example, the church may face limited resources or cultural barriers that make it challenging to provide effective discipleship programs. However, the church can work to address these challenges by prioritizing teaching and education, creating mentorship relationships, and adapting discipleship programs to the cultural context in which they operate.

Ultimately, effective discipleship requires a commitment to the process of spiritual growth and development, as well as a willingness to address the challenges that may arise along the way. By doing so, churches can create a culture of discipleship that transforms lives and impacts the world for Christ.






Another scholar who has written about the challenges of discipleship is Richard Foster. He argues that the challenge 
of effective discipleship is that it requires a fundamental shift in the way we approach spiritual growth. Instead of
 relying on human effort and willpower, we must learn to rely on the Holy Spirit and cultivate a deeper relationship with
  God. Foster also emphasizes the need for accountability and community in discipleship, and the importance of spiritual 
  disciplines like prayer, meditation, and fasting.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
The challenges of effective discipleship have several negative effects on individuals and the church. These effects include:
a) Stunted growth: Lack of effective discipleship leads to stunted growth in individuals, preventing them from becoming mature Christians.

b) Spiritual immaturity: Lack of effective discipleship leads to spiritual immaturity, where individuals are not equipped to deal 
with the challenges of life.

c) Weak church: Lack of

effective discipleship also weakens the church as a whole. Without a strong culture of discipleship, the church may struggle to fulfill
 its mission of making disciples and spreading the gospel.

d) Missed opportunities: Without effective discipleship, individuals may miss opportunities to grow in their faith, discover their
 unique calling, and use their gifts to serve God and others.

Case study: ECWA Gobe DCC
As a case study, we can examine the discipleship program at ECWA Gobe DCC (Deeper Christian Life Ministry) in Nigeria. ECWA Gobe
 DCC is a branch of the Deeper Christian Life Ministry, a worldwide ministry that focuses on discipleship and spiritual growth.
The discipleship program at ECWA Gobe DCC is designed to help individuals grow in their faith and develop their spiritual gifts. 
The program includes Bible study, prayer, mentoring relationships, and opportunities for service and ministry.

However, the program also faces several challenges, including a lack of commitment from some members, a lack of resources, and 
cultural barriers. These challenges have hindered the growth of the program and prevented some individuals from participating fully.

Despite these challenges, the discipleship program at ECWA Gobe DCC has had a positive impact on many individuals, helping them 
grow in their faith and become more committed followers of Christ. The program has also contributed to the growth and health of
 the church as a whole.

Conclusion:
Effective discipleship is essential for the growth and health of individuals and the church as a whole. However, several challenges 
hinder effective discipleship, including lack of commitment, resources, and understanding, as well as cultural barriers. Scholars 
have identified these challenges and provided insights on how to address them.
As demonstrated by the case study of ECWA Gobe DCC, effective discipleship programs can have a positive impact on individuals and 
the church. By understanding and addressing the challenges of discipleship, churches can create a culture of discipleship that
 fosters spiritual growth, maturity, and service.

 Sure, here's a more comprehensive explanation of the challenges of effective discipleship and their effects:

Lack of commitment: Effective discipleship requires a deep commitment to the process of spiritual growth and development. However, 
many individuals may attend church and participate in discipleship programs without fully committing themselves to the process. 
This lack of commitment can result in a lack of progress and growth in discipleship.
The effects of this challenge are significant. When individuals lack commitment to discipleship, they may 
miss out on opportunities for spiritual growth and development. They may also struggle to fully engage in the life of the
 church and to serve God and others effectively. Furthermore, a lack of commitment to discipleship can result in a lack
  of overall commitment to the church, which can weaken the church's impact on the community.

Lack of resources: Effective discipleship requires resources such as time, money, and trained leaders. However, many churches 
may struggle to provide these resources, especially in areas with limited resources or where the church is still developing.
The effects of this challenge are also significant. Without sufficient resources, churches may struggle to provide effective 
discipleship programs, hindering the growth and development of individuals and the church as a whole. This can result in a 
lack of spiritual maturity among church members and a weakened ability to fulfill the church's mission of making disciples
 and spreading the gospel.

Cultural barriers: Different cultures may have different attitudes and approaches to discipleship, which can create
 barriers to effective discipleship. For example, some cultures may prioritize individualism and self-sufficiency over 
 community and interdependence, which can make it challenging to foster a culture of discipleship.
The effects of cultural barriers can also be significant. Cultural barriers can prevent individuals from fully engaging 
in the discipleship process, hindering their growth and development. They can also create divisions within the church and
 limit the effectiveness of the church's discipleship programs. Churches must work to understand the cultural context in 
 which they operate and adapt their discipleship programs accordingly.

Lack of understanding: Effective discipleship requires a deep understanding of the gospel, as well as biblical principles
 and practices. However, many individuals may have a limited understanding of these concepts, making it challenging to engage 
 fully in discipleship.
The effects of this challenge are significant as well. Without a deep understanding of the gospel and biblical principles,
 individuals may struggle to grow in their faith and to fully engage in the life of the church. Churches must prioritize 
 teaching and education to help individuals develop a deeper understanding of these concepts.

Lack of accountability: Accountability is an essential component of effective discipleship, as it helps individuals to stay 
on track and to maintain their commitment to spiritual growth. However, many individuals may lack accountability, either because
 they don't have access to mentors or because they are resistant to being held accountable.
The effects of a lack of accountability can also be significant. Without accountability, individuals may struggle to maintain 
their commitment to discipleship, hindering their growth and development. Churches must prioritize developing mentorship 
relationships and creating a culture of accountability to help individuals stay on track in their spiritual growth.

Limited time and competing priorities: In today's fast-paced world, many individuals may struggle to find time for discipleship 
amid competing priorities such as work, family, and other activities.
The effects of limited time can be significant as well. Limited time can make it challenging for individuals 
to fully engage in discipleship, hindering their growth and development. Churches must work to create discipleship programs
 that are flexible and adaptable to individuals' busy schedules.

Overall, the challenges of effective discipleship are numerous and significant. However, by understanding these challenge
s and working to address them, churches can create a culture of discipleship that fosters spiritual growth, maturity, and 
service. The effects of effective discipleship can

be transformative, both for individuals and for the church as a whole. Effective discipleship can lead to a deeper understanding 
of the gospel, a greater commitment to spiritual growth, and a stronger sense of community within the church. It can also equip 
individuals to serve God and others more effectively and to fulfill the church's mission of making disciples and spreading the gospel.

In the case of ECWA Gobe DCC, there may be specific challenges related to the context in which the church operates. For example,
 the church may face limited resources or cultural barriers that make it challenging to provide effective discipleship programs.
  However, the church can work to address these challenges by prioritizing teaching and education, creating mentorship relationships,
   and adapting discipleship programs to the cultural context in which they operate.

Ultimately, effective discipleship requires a commitment to the process of spiritual growth and development, as well as a willingness 
to address the challenges that may arise along the way. By doing so, churches can create a culture of discipleship that transforms lives
 and impacts the world for Christ.

 SCHALAR SAYING


There are many scholars who have written about the challenges of effective discipleship, and their perspectives can provide 
valuable insights into this topic.

One scholar who has written extensively about discipleship is Dallas Willard. He emphasizes the importance of intentional 
training and the need for discipleship to be integrated into all aspects of life. Willard argues that the challenge of 
effective discipleship is that it requires a significant commitment of time and effort on the part of both the disciple
 and the mentor, and that it cannot be reduced to a program or set of rules. He also emphasizes the need for a transformation
  of the heart, rather than just a change in behavior.

Another scholar who has written about the challenges of discipleship is Richard Foster. He argues that the challenge of
 effective discipleship is that it requires a fundamental shift in the way we approach spiritual growth. Instead of relying 
 on human effort and willpower, we must learn to rely on the Holy Spirit and cultivate a deeper relationship with God. Foster 
 also emphasizes the need for accountability and community in discipleship, and the importance of spiritual disciplines like
  prayer, meditation, and fasting.

A third scholar who has written about the challenges of discipleship is David Platt. He argues that the challenge of
 effective discipleship is that it requires us to prioritize our relationship with God above all else, and to be willing 
 to make sacrifices for the sake of the gospel. Platt emphasizes the need for discipleship to be focused on making more 
 disciples, rather than just personal growth, and the importance of confronting cultural idols and injustice.

In addition to these scholars, there are many others who have written about the challenges of effective discipleship, including 
Francis Chan, J.D. Greear, and John Piper. These scholars emphasize a variety of themes, including the need for authenticity and
 vulnerability in discipleship, the importance of being rooted in scripture, and the challenge of cultural opposition to discipleship.

Overall, the scholars who have written about the challenges of effective discipleship emphasize the importance of intentional
 training, a deep relationship with God, accountability and community, and a focus on making disciples. They also recognize 
 that discipleship is not easy, and that it requires a significant commitment of time and effort. However, they believe that 
 the rewards of effective discipleship are well worth the challenges, and that it can lead to a transformed life and a powerful
  impact on the world.

make it longer
Continuing from the previous response, the scholars also recognize that there are several challenges to effective discipleship, some of 
which are related to the individual and others to the larger community or society. One challenge is that individuals may struggle to 
prioritize their spiritual growth in the midst of the demands of daily life. This can result in a lack of time, energy, or motivation
 to engage in discipleship practices, which in turn can lead to a lack of growth and transformation.

Another challenge is that discipleship can be uncomfortable and even painful at times. It requires us to confront our own sin and 
shortcomings, as well as to confront cultural norms and values that may be at odds with the gospel. This can be difficult and can 
lead to resistance or pushback from others.

A third challenge is that effective discipleship requires a significant investment of time and resources from the church community.
 This can be particularly challenging in contexts where resources are limited or where the church is facing significant cultural 
 opposition or persecution.

In response to these challenges, scholars offer several suggestions for how churches and individuals can address them. For example,
 churches can prioritize teaching and education, creating mentorship relationships, and adapting discipleship programs to the cultural
  context in which they operate. They can also encourage accountability and community, as well as a focus on making disciples rather 
  than just personal growth.

Individuals can also take steps to address the challenges of discipleship. For example, they can prioritize their spiritual growth by 
setting aside time for prayer, meditation, and reflection, as well as by engaging in regular scripture study and discipleship practices.
 They can also seek out mentorship relationships and accountability partners, and can actively work to confront their own sin and 
 shortcomings.

The effects of these challenges are significant, both for individuals and for the larger church community. When individuals struggle
 to prioritize their spiritual growth, they may experience a lack of direction or purpose in their lives, as well as a sense of 
 disconnect from the larger church community. When discipleship is uncomfortable or painful, it can lead to resistance or pushback 
 from others, which can in turn create division or disunity within the church. And when resources are limited or cultural opposition 
 is high, it can be difficult for the church to fulfill its mission of making disciples and spreading the gospel.

In the case of ECWA Gobe DCC, these challenges may be particularly acute. For example, the church may be facing limited resources
 or cultural barriers that make it challenging to provide effective discipleship programs. However, by recognizing and addressing 
 these challenges, the church can create a culture of discipleship that transforms lives and impacts the world for Christ.

 DALLAS Willard


 Dallas Willard was a prominent Christian philosopher, theologian, and author who wrote extensively on the subject of discipleship. He 
 believed that discipleship was not just a matter of following a set of rules or practices, but rather a transformation of the whole person into the likeness of Christ. Willard saw discipleship as a lifelong journey that requires intentionality and effort, but that ultimately leads to a deeper relationship with God and a more meaningful and purposeful life.

One of the key ideas that Willard emphasized was the importance of spiritual disciplines. He believed that spiritual disciplines such as prayer, fasting, solitude, and meditation were essential for spiritual growth and transformation. Willard argued that these disciplines help us to develop the habits and practices that are necessary for a life of discipleship, and that they enable us to experience the presence and power of God in our lives.

Another key idea that Willard emphasized was the role of the community in discipleship. He believed that discipleship is not just an individual pursuit, but a communal one. Willard argued that the church is called to be a community of disciples who support and encourage one another in their spiritual journeys. He believed that the church should prioritize discipleship and spiritual formation, and that it should create opportunities for its members to grow and mature in their faith.

Willard also emphasized the importance of the mind in discipleship. He believed that discipleship requires us to develop a Christian worldview and to think deeply about the implications of our faith for all areas of life. Willard argued that the mind is not just a tool for understanding the world, but a spiritual organ that can be transformed by God's grace. He believed that discipleship requires us to engage in intellectual inquiry and to seek understanding and wisdom in all areas of life.

In terms of the challenges of discipleship, Willard recognized that there are many obstacles that can prevent us from growing and maturing in our faith. He saw busyness, distraction, and a lack of intentionality as some of the main challenges that individuals face in their spiritual journeys. He also recognized that the culture of consumerism and individualism in the West can make it difficult for people to prioritize spiritual growth and to embrace the disciplines and practices of discipleship.

To address these challenges, Willard offered several suggestions. He believed that we need to be intentional about our spiritual growth and to make it a priority in our lives. He encouraged us to develop a rhythm of life that includes regular times of prayer, meditation, and reflection, as well as opportunities for learning and growth. Willard also emphasized the importance of community and accountability, and he encouraged us to seek out mentors and spiritual guides who can help us in our discipleship journey.

Overall, Dallas Willard's approach to discipleship emphasizes the importance of intentional effort, spiritual disciplines, community, and intellectual inquiry. He believed that discipleship is a lifelong journey that requires us to cultivate habits and practices that enable us to grow in our faith and to become more like Christ. While there are many challenges to effective discipleship, Willard believed that with intentionality and effort, we can overcome these obstacles and experience the transformative power of God's grace in our lives.

ADULTERY




It is important to note that adultery is a sensitive and controversial topic that has been studied across many societies throughout history. Adultery is the act of having a sexual relationship with someone who is not one's spouse or partner. In this exposition, we will examine the issue of adultery in society and explore the period when it became rampant, the factors responsible for its high rate, the conceptions of adultery, the various ways it is practiced, and possible ways of minimizing it.

Determine the exact period adultery became rampant in society:
It is difficult to determine the exact period when adultery became rampant in society as it varies across cultures and time periods. However, research indicates that adultery has been prevalent throughout history and across different societies. According to some scholars, the prevalence of adultery can be traced back to the ancient civilizations of Egypt, Rome, and Greece. These societies had different attitudes towards adultery, with some accepting it, while others viewed it as a punishable offense. In contemporary society, adultery continues to be a significant social issue, and the prevalence has increased in recent years due to various factors.

Identifying factors responsible for the high rate of adultery:
Several factors contribute to the high rate of adultery in society. One of the significant factors is the lack of sexual satisfaction in a relationship. When partners are not satisfied sexually, they may seek fulfillment outside the relationship. Additionally, the societal pressure to conform to traditional gender roles can lead to feelings of boredom and dissatisfaction in a relationship, which can then lead to infidelity. The prevalence of technology and social media also contributes to the high rate of adultery, as it provides easy access to new partners and makes it easier to conceal the activity.

Finding out the conceptions of adultery in society:
The concept of adultery varies across cultures and societies. In some societies, adultery is viewed as a criminal offense, while in others, it is viewed as a violation of religious or moral values. In contemporary society, adultery is viewed as a personal transgression that can damage trust and destroy relationships. Adultery is also linked to cultural and religious beliefs, where it is believed that adultery can bring bad luck and misfortune to the family. The societal perceptions of adultery can also vary based on gender, with women often facing more severe consequences than men.

Discuss the various ways of practicing adultery in society:
Adultery can take several forms, including having extramarital affairs, engaging in premarital sex, and having multiple partners. Adultery is often conducted in secret, and people use various methods to conceal their activities, such as using secret codes and communicating through private messaging apps. Social media and dating apps have made it easier to find partners for adulterous relationships. Additionally, people may engage in emotional affairs, where they form deep emotional connections with someone outside their relationship.

Finding possible ways of minimizing adultery in society:
Minimizing adultery in society requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the underlying cultural and social factors that contribute to its prevalence. Effective sex education and reproductive health services are essential to help people understand the consequences of their actions and make informed decisions about their sexual activities. It is also important to promote gender equality and discourage traditional gender roles that may lead to boredom and dissatisfaction in a relationship. Encouraging open and honest communication between partners can also help prevent misunderstandings and infidelity. Additionally, community-based programs and religious organizations can play a vital role in promoting moral values and educating people about the negative consequences of adultery.
